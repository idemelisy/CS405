CS405 Project 1 — Transformations, Projection, and Curves

Overview

This project builds a minimal 3D WebGL application demonstrating the mathematical foundations of computer graphics: rigid transformations, camera setup, projection, and Bézier curves. Students will implement these operations using JavaScript and WebGL to visualize how geometry moves from model space to screen space.

Learning Objectives

By completing this project, students will:
1. Implement affine and rigid-body transformations using 4×4 matrices.
2. Construct a camera coordinate system and apply the view matrix.
3. Implement perspective projection using a projection matrix.
4. Generate Bézier curves in 2D and 3D space.
5. Understand the complete transformation chain: p_clip = P × V × M × p_object.
6. Develop clean WebGL rendering code that connects mathematics to visualization.

Part A — Rigid Transformations (Week 3–4)

• Implement translation, rotation, and scaling using 4×4 matrices.
• Allow interactive adjustment of object parameters via UI.
• Display transformation matrices on screen.
• Demonstrate order dependence: TRS vs RTS.

Part B — Camera and View Matrix (Week 4)

• Implement a lookAt() function: V = lookAt(eye, target, up).
• Visualize camera coordinate axes (X=red, Y=green, Z=blue).
• Enable interactive camera movement around an object.
• Render the camera frustum to illustrate field of view.

Part C — Perspective Projection (Week 4–5)

• Implement the perspective projection matrix: P = perspective(fov, aspect, near, far).
• Compare orthographic and perspective projections.
• Visualize how objects map into clip space and screen space.
• Allow toggling between camera, clip, and screen space views.

Part D — Bézier Curves (Week 5)

• Implement cubic Bézier curve: B(t)= (1−t)³P₀ + 3(1−t)²tP₁ + 3(1−t)t²P₂ + t³P₃.
• Visualize control points and the control polygon.
• Animate an object moving along the Bézier curve.
• (Optional) Extend to piecewise Bézier or spline curves.

Part E — Integration and Visualization (Week 6)

• Combine transformations, camera, projection, and Bézier elements into a single WebGL scene.
• Provide controls to toggle projection mode, start/stop animation, and reset.
• Ensure modular code structure with clear separation of math, rendering, and UI.

Implementation Rules

• Use JavaScript + WebGL only (no external libraries).
• Column-major matrices consistent with WebGL conventions.
• Export matrix data in JSON format.
• Maintain clean code and clear commenting.

Deliverables

1. index.html — main WebGL application.
2. js/ — separate JavaScript files for math, camera, Bézier, and rendering.
3. assets/ — optional simple texture or cube model.
4. report.pdf — 3–4 pages with math, screenshots, and discussion.
5. (Optional) demo.mp4 — short demonstration video (≤3 min).
