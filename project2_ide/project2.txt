Project 2: Non-Photorealistic Rendering Shaders in WebGL1. Project OverviewIn this term project, students will design and implement a collection of Non-Photorealistic Rendering (NPR) shadersusing WebGL. The goal is to explore how artistic styles—particularly those inspired by oil painting brushstrokes, ink drawings, and hand-crafted illustration techniques—can be simulated through programmable shading. Students are expected to combine technical understanding of GPU shader programming with creative experimentation in visual style.The final system will be a custom rendering pipelinecapable of applying multiple NPR effects to 3D models or scenes in real time. Students should provide a clear way to compare different NPR algorithms, both visually and technically.2. Learning ObjectivesBy completing this project, students will:•Gain hands-on experience with WebGL, GLSL shader programming, and GPU pipelines.•Understand core NPR techniques and their mathematical/algorithmic foundations.•Explore how traditional artistic styles (e.g., oil brushstrokes, hatching, contouring) can be transformed into digital rendering strategies.•Build an extensible rendering pipeline that combines vertex shaders, fragment shaders, post-processing passes, and optional multi-pass rendering.•Demonstrate algorithmic creativity by designing at least one customNPR effect inspired by an artistic medium.3. NPR Techniques to ExploreStudents must implement at least twoof the NPR techniques below, including at least one student-designed or significantly extended method.Core Techniques:•Toon Shading (Cel Shading)Simplified lighting model with quantized shading bands and stylized highlights.•Edge Detection (Silhouette or Screen-Space Edges)Detect feature edges usingnormal discontinuities, depth differences•Hatching / Cross-Hatching(difficult!)Tone-mapping via line textures or procedural strokes, dynamically aligned with surface curvature or lighting gradients.•Oil-Painting Brushstroke Simulation(easy to implement, but requires some planning) 
Using noise functions, stroke textures, or tangent-space orientation to mimic the layered textured look of oil paint.4. Requirements & DeliverablesA. Functional Requirements1.A WebGL-based renderer capable of loading and displaying at least one 3D model or scene.2.Multiple NPR shaders selectable at runtime (minimum: two distinct techniques).3.A comparison interface (toggle or side-by-side view) to evaluate stylistic differences across techniques.4.Real-time rendering (≥30 FPS on a typical laptop GPU).B. Technical Requirements•Code must use WebGLor WebGL2directly (no Three.js).•GLSL shaders must be written by the student.•Proper use of uniforms, attributes, buffers, textures, and shader programs.•Clean modular architecture (e.g., shader loader, model loader, render loop).C. DocumentationA written report (4–6pages) including:1.Description of each NPR algorithmimplemented, with formulas or pseudocode.2.Artistic inspiration, including at least one oil painting or brushstroke technique.3.Comparative analysisof the shaders: performance, visual expressiveness, limitations.4.Implementation details: design decisions, pipeline diagrams, optimization steps.5.Screenshotsof each method applied to the same object/scene.5. Suggested Tools & Resources•WebGL / WebGL2 API•glMatrix or lightweight math libraries (optional)•OBJ/GLTF model loaders (student-implemented or minimal adapted code)•Online shader tools (ShaderToy, GLSL Sandbox) for prototyping•Reference literature on NPR (Strothotte & Schlechtweg, Gooch et al.
